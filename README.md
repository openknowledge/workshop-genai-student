# workshop-genai-student
Students material for the **open knowledge**  full day  hands-on workshop on **GenAI** and **RAG**.

## What is the workshop about?
Thanks to powerful frameworks and libraries, the first generative AI applications at the 
Hello World level can be implemented with just a few lines of code. However, these first 
attempts quickly reach their limits. Why? Because reality presents challenges that cannot 
be easily solved with this trivial approach. 

But what is needed for a generative AI application at the enterprise level? 
A well-thought-out generative AI architecture! In this full-day hands-on workshop, 
we will build a complex Generative AI application step by step to query the in-house, 
distributed domain knowledge via chat. 

Examples of this distributed knowledge could be the entire expertise of an IT department, 
product information and specifications of an international retailer or the internal employee 
portal of a large company. 

Starting with a minimalist RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system, we consider 
various challenges and discuss suitable solutions. By the end, we will have an architecture 
that can withstand the challenges of reality.
